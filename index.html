    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Soumil Gogna,I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi, with a CGPA of 7.92. I have strong programming skills in C++, Python, and experience with tools like Arduino IDE, EasyEDA, and SolidWorks. In addition to this, I have a background in web development, working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have solved over 900+ DSA problems across platforms and have consistently ranked high, including achieving a 97% accuracy rate and a score of 42160 on InterviewBit. I have also topped the college leaderboard on Coding Ninjas twice.
        One of my key projects is ENVISCRIPE, an environmental data logger that visualizes sensor readings and processes data for outliers. I also worked on a Concave Shape Detector, where I built a system that uses a moving car to detect concavities like dents in equipment. In another project, I developed a multi-sensor device management system that handles real-time data and sensor control. Additionally, I have worked on and optimized algorithms, such as implementing the LRU cache with various data structures, and solved complex problems related to subsequences and constraints. With a passion for problem-solving, I continuously seek challenges that enhance my technical expertise.
